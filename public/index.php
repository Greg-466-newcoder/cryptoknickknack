                <h1>What is Cryptocurrency?</h1>
                <h3>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
                   which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies
                    are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced
                     by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they
                      are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune
                       to government interference or manipulation.</h3>

                <h1>What is bitcoin?</h1>
                <h3>At its most basic principle, Bitcoin is a relatively new and purely digital currency that
                   offers each and every one of us a fairer financial system where everyone is an equal.

                   There are no physical bitcoins in existence with ownership provided by a public ledger
                    to give complete transparency across all currency holders. Since its launch in 2009,
                     Bitcoin has grown to be the largest crypto currency sparking a new wave of financial
                      transactions with many other digital currencies following in the innovative footsteps.</h3>
